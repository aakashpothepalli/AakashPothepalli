### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at MSRIT pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I have been developing apps and websites for around a year and a half now. I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart, C++ and a little bit of python.

I like solving Algorithmic problems and I generally practice my CP skills on Codechef and Codeforces.. I enjoy participating in Hackathons and coding competitions. You can find the link to my competitive programming profiles at the bottom.

I have worked on six projects with Flutter, react and Nodejs. Two of them are award-winning projects by our team [Impractical Coders](https://github.com/teamimpracticalcoders/).

I am also a Core member of [Statefully Fidgeting](https://github.com/Statefully-Fidgeting). Recently my team and I have launched a game on playstore.If you're interested, check out our game [Tug Of War - A Witty Multiplayer Game ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.statefullyfidgeting.tugofwar)

I'm really passionate about programming in general. I feel that programming is the greatest thing humanity has ever built.
