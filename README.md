### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aakash. I am a student at MSRIT completing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I have been developing apps and websites for around a year. Most of my experience lies in backend development. I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart, C++  and a little bit of python.

I like solving Algorithmic problems in my free time. I am active on competitive programming websites like Codechef and Codeforces.

I regularly participate in Hackathons and coding competitions. I am proud to say that I have secured 1st and 2nd position's in 4 contests in a year. 

I have worked on six projects with Flutter, react and Nodejs. Two of them are award-winning collaboratory projects by our team [Impractical Coders](https://github.com/teamimpracticalcoders/).

Building projects and solving algorithmic questions excites me a lot and I would really like to continue doing both.
